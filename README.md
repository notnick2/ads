this is not the final output 
just achieved connection between react and fast API servers 
to resolve:
put request from fast API to react

ads.json doesn't include a complete database but is a sample JSON file as the database is too large
make sure to run a fast API server in the virtual environment 

use the following to create and run on a virtual environment

python -m venv venv

.\venv\Scripts\activate

uvicorn app:app --reload
